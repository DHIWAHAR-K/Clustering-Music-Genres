# Music Genre Clustering using Python

## Overview

This Python script demonstrates music genre clustering using unsupervised learning and the `scikit-learn` library. The script uses a dataset containing audio features of music tracks and applies clustering algorithms to group them into genres. Explore this script to understand the basics of clustering music genres in Python.

## Script Components

- **Library Installation:** Installing the necessary libraries (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and others if required).
- **Dataset Loading:** Loading a dataset containing audio features of music tracks.
- **Data Exploration:** Exploring and understanding the structure of the dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for clustering.
- **Clustering Algorithm:** Applying clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) using `scikit-learn`.
- **Visualizing Clusters:** Utilizing `matplotlib` to visualize the clusters of music genres.
- **Output Display:** Displaying the generated visualizations and cluster information.

## Running the Script

1. Install the required libraries by running `pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib` in your Python environment.
2. Open and run the Python script (`music_genre_clustering.py`) in a Python environment.
3. The script will load the music dataset, apply clustering algorithms, and generate visualizations.

## Customization

- Replace the dataset with your own music-related data for specific clustering.
- Experiment with different clustering algorithms and parameters to improve results.
- Modify the script to include additional features or interactive visualizations.
